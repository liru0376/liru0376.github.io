<h2>A LITTLE ABOUT ME!</h2>
<div class="aboutme-2">
  <p>Hi there, welcome to my page! My name is Lily Rudder-- I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, but I have lived in Boulder for the past four years where I graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder in May. I got my BS in Strategic Communication with an emphasis on Media Design, and I have a minor in Creative Technology and Design. I am young, driven, and highly creative individual who is constantly striving to be better and do more. I can confidently say I have a natural eye for design and am extremely passionate about it too. I was a part of the Advertising, Public Relations, and Design program and have worked in Marketing with two different companies. Throughout these experiences, I have developed a deep understanding of how strategic design solves challenges within marketing and leads to strong and successful brand identities. I have experience in the Adobe Creative Suite, CSS/HTML, social media marketing, brand design, web design, graphic design, and other areas of design. I pride myself in being an excellent listener, communicator, collaborator, and strategic thinker. I love to have fun and I believe it is important to love what you do; I am excited that I am pursuing a career in something I have been so passionate about my entire life. </p>
