        <h2 id="Appearance-section">Appearance</h2>
        <p>Each Bernedoodle's appearance can vary because it is a crossbreed, meaning each litter has genetically different parents.
        As the generations of the crossbreed progress, the ability to produce litters with more consistent traits increases.</p>
        <p>Bernedoodles range in size. Toy, miniature, and standard sized dogs are found, depending on what type of Poodle is used for breeding.
        The toy size will grow 10-14" tall and weigh between 10-24 lbs. The miniature size will grow 15-20" tall and weigh between 25-49 lbs.
        The standard size will grow 23-29" tall and weigh between 70-90 lbs.</p>
        <p>Bernedoodle coats are typically wavy and curly, which results in minimal shedding. Curly coats require frequent brushing to prevent
        tangles, as well as periodic trimming. Bernedoodles can range in colors, with the most common combinations being either black, black and brown,
        black and white, or black, white, and brown.</p>
