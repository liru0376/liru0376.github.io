        <h2 id="Appearance-section">Appearance</h2>
        <p>Each Bernedoodle's appearance can vary because it is a crossbreed, meaning each litter has genetically different parents.
        As the generations of the crossbreed progress, the ability to produce litters with more consistent traits increases.</p>
        <p>Bernedoodles range in size. Toy, miniature, and standard sized dogs are found, depending on what type of Poodle is used for breeding.
        The toy size will grow 10-14" tall and weigh between 10-24 lbs. The miniature size will grow 15-20" tall and weigh between 25-49 lbs.
        The standard size will grow 23-29" tall and weigh between 70-90 lbs.</p>
        <p>Bernedoodle coats are typically wavy and curly, which results in minimal shedding. Curly coats require frequent brushing to prevent
        tangles, as well as periodic trimming. Bernedoodles can range in colors, with the most common combinations being either black, black and brown,
        black and white, or black, white, and brown.</p>

        <h2 id="Temperament-section">Temperament</h2>
        <p>The Bernedoodle is steady-tempered and easygoing. Bernedoodles are moderate to high energy breed. This means they need at least 30 - 60 minutes of daily exercise. Exercise is important to prevent Bernedoodle from adopting problem behaviors such as being destructive. Indeed, the Bernedoodle loves getting out, especially in cool weather. With their thick coat, they can still do well in warm climates. Romping in the snow is an enjoyable form of recreation for this breed, and pulling carts and sleds is a wonderful source of exercise, especially if it involves children.</p>
        <p>Bernedoodles make great family dogs because they are friendly and easy to socialize. A lot of intelligence is passed on from the Poodle parent, which allows the Bernedoodle to be able to work as a therapy dog, with the proper training. The Bernedoodle will learn commands quicker than other dogs as a result of this intelligence.</p>
        <p>Bernedoodles may display some stubbornness, which comes from the Bernese Mountain Dog parent.[6] This mainly occurs as a puppy and will typically subside with age and disciplined training.</p>

        <h2 id="Health-section">Health</h2>
        <p>Bernedoodles have a life expectancy of 12-18 years. Because it is a newer crossbreed, there is still a lack of data about potential health concerns. Some insights can be gained from the parent breeds, however, it is intended that a crossbreed inherit the best characteristics of its parent breeds, which may result in a longer life and fewer genetic health issues. A study conducted by Carol Beuchat, at the Institute of Canine Biology, suggests that purebred dogs have a greater risk of developing genetic health disorders, in comparison to crossbreed dogs. Elbow dysplasia is a known health concern that occurs in Bernedoodles. It is important that parents are properly tested for this genetic issue prior to being bred.</p>
